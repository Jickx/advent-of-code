# Advent of Code 2015

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) programming puzzles.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. For more information, visit the [official website](https://adventofcode.com).

## How to Run

To run a solution for a specific day:

1.  Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  Place the puzzle input for a given day in the `input/` directory (e.g., `input/day_01.txt`).
3.  Run the corresponding script from your terminal:

    ```sh
    python day_XX.py
    ```

    Replace `XX` with the day number you want to run (e.g., `01`, `05`).
